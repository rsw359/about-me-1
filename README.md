## About Me, with a guessing game

I built a guessing game to help people learn more about me. It accomplishes this through the use of Javascript and simple responses converted to specific typecasing to allow for variations in text formatting.

## Reflections and Comments

### Reflections

- Linting is super helpful for you to know that you're doing something incorrectly to allow you to figure out something needs to change.
- Certain attributes in CSS must be done in a specific order or else formatting is incorrect.
- Reset CSS pages help to give clean formatting to your site so it looks similar across platforms.
- Pay careful attention to formatting, and where semicolons should go.

### Comments

- Thanks to the TA that came and helped me realize I was missing a simple pair or parenthesis and that is what was breaking most of my code.
- Operandums and Operators can be a bit confusing and I definitely need more experience with them.
- JavaScript still gives me some struggles but I am having fun with it.
