    <div id="videogames">
      <h4>Video Games</h4>
      <p>I really enjoy playing videogames with my friends online. I have played many MMORPGs (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games) and still play quite a few. Curently I play FFXIV. My passion though lies in Japanese style role playing games and horror games. I loathe First Person Shooters since I'm not very good at them.</p>

    <div id="hobbies">
      <h4>Hobbies</h4>
      <p>Some of my hobbies are quite varied, I already told you about videogames, but aside from that. I also love to do off trail wilderness hiking, and go foraging for mushrooms every year in the fall. I also do leatherworking as a side hobby to bring in some extra money on top of my previous work.  </p>
